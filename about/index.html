<div class="blurb">
	<h1 style = "font-family: helvetica; font-size: 130%; text-align:center;">Hi there</h1>
	<p  style = "font-family: helvetica; font-size: 100%">My name is Brian Wray. I'm a full-time staff member of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, and a full-time 
	Master's student studying Computer Science at DePaul's CDM school.
	<br/><br/>
	I'm interested broadly in bioinformatics, software engineering and data science. Right now I work with Field Museum curators to use DNA data in order to help further understand the nature of relationships between organisms at the species level. I work with <a href="http://www.moreaulab.org/">Associate Curators Corrie Moreau (ants)</a>, <a href="http://www.reelab.net/home/">Rick Ree (flowering plants)</a>, <a href="https://www.fieldmuseum.org/about/staff/profile/426"> Thorsten Lumbsch (lichens)</a>, <a href="https://www.fieldmuseum.org/about/staff/profile/71">Shannon Hackett (birds)</a>, and <a href="https://www.fieldmuseum.org/about/staff/profile/206">John Bates (birds)</a>.
	<br/><br/>
	In addition to working with data, I spend a fair amount of time training visiting scientists in lab and computational techniques. I'm also involved in our exhibit's "Talk to the Scientist Hour", weekdays from 11-12. 
	</br></br>
	Like all humans, I contain multitudes! Too much to flesh out on a simple "about" section of a scrappy little website. Hit me up and let's talk.
