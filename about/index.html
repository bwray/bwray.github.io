<div class="blurb">
	<h1 style = "font-family: helvetica; font-size: 110%; text-align:center;">Hi there</h1>
	<p  style = "font-family: helvetica; font-size: 100%">>My name is Brian Wray. I'm a full-time staff member of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, and a full-time 
	student studying CS at DePaul's CDM school. In addition, I'm a husband and a father. In my free time, I like to imagine a world in which
	I actually have some free time. 
	<br/>
	I'm interested broadly in bioinformatics, software engineering and data science. Right now I'm working in the context of evolutionary biology
	to understand the nature of relationships between organisms at the species level. I work for a number of different curators at the Field Museum, though I primarily
	 work with <a href="http://www.moreaulab.org/">Associate Curator Corrie Moreau (ants)</a> and <a href="http://www.reelab.net/home/">Associate Curator Rick Ree (flowering plants)</a>.<br/>
	I commute to work on my bicycle, which can be a real challenge in this city. My ride is 18 miles round-trip, and I ride every weekday unless there is snow on the ground and/or 
	the temperature dips below 20&#8457 (or -6.5&#8451). I am an amateur photographer, but since my son was born I have been reduced
	to little more than a toddler paparazzo. I really love to cook. Cooking blends both art and science together into a delicious project that had a well-defined
	beginning and end. I have scorched, soured and undercooked many, many dishes, but rarely do I make the same unpallatable dish twice.</p>
