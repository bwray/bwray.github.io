	My name is Brian Wray. I'm a programmer, 
	biologist, husband, father, reader, writer, traveler, photographer, and wannabe musician. 
	By day, I'm a bioinformatic analyst at the cancer center at the Feinberg School of Medicine 
	at Northwestern University. By night, I do what I can to stay away from the computer 
	and other types of screens, the exception being on Tuesday nights where I attend 
	<a href="https://chihacknight.org/">ChiHackNight</a> to help build civic-minded data 
	science tools.
	
	<br/><br/>
	
	My biological background is mostly within molecular and evolutionary biology. I got my 
	B.S. in Biology from Northeastern Illinois University in 2009 and worked at the Field 
	Museum of Natural History's Pritzker Lab for Molecular Systematics for 9 years. My work
	at the museum involved sequencing a lot of DNA, training a lot of scientists in lab
	and computational techniques, teaching the public about our research, and traveling
	to exotic locales to collect insect specimens.
	
	<br/><br/>
	
	My programming background started by graduating with a M.S. in Computer Science
	from DePaul University in 2017. The DePaul program was great because it offered an 
	optional preliminary year of classes to get people like me with no programming background
	up to speed on things like systems and data structures. I somehow managed to finish my 
	degree in three years while working full time and not getting divorced.

	This website is a way for me to continue developing as a, um, developer. It's a place for 
	me to keep track of projects that I work on and to present them, along with my mercurial 
	inner thoughts, to the world. Welcome! 
	
	</br></br>
	
	Like all humans, I contain multitudes! Too much to flesh out on a simple "about" section of a scrappy little website. Hit me up and let's talk.
