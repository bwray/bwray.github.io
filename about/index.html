<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Hi there</h1>
	<p>My name is Brian Wray. I'm a full-time staff member of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, a full-time 
	student studying CS at DePaul's CDM school, and I'm a husband and father. In my free time, I like to imagine a world in which
	I actually have some free time. </a></p>
	<p>Seriously though, I do actually have time for a few hobbies in my life. I commute to work on my bicycle, which can be a real
	challenge in this city. My ride is nine miles long each way, and I ride every weekday unless there is snow on the ground and/or 
	the temperature dips below 20&#8457 (or -6.5&#8451). I am an amateur photographer, but since my son was born I have been reduced
	to little more than a toddler paparazzo. </p>
	<p>I really love to cook. Cooking blends both art and science together into a delicious project that had a well-defined
	beginning and end. I have scorched, soured and undercooked many, many dishes, but rarely do I make the same unpallatable dish twice.</p>
