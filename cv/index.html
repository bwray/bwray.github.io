				<p>Hi. I'm a Museum scientist involved in evolutionary biology, molecular genetics, bioinformatics and public outreach.
				<br></br>
				I'm also a Master's student studying Computer Science at DePaul University. I plan on graduating with my MS in June, 2017.</p>
				
				<h2>Degree</h2>
				<p>BS, Biology, Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago, IL, 2009</p>
				
				<h2>Professional Employment</h2>
				<p><strong>Research Assistant III, Pritzker Lab for Molecular Systematics, Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago</strong></p>
				<p><strong>2012 - present</strong></p>				
				<ul>
				<li>Primary technician for the Field Museum's core genomics facility.</li>
				
				<li>I generate and analyze molecular data for a great variety of different organisms. I have worked primarily on ant and flowering plant tissues, 
				but I also have experience with fungal, vertebrate and microbiome data.</li>  

				<li>I work at all levels of the science, including experiment design, field work (i.e. collecting), DNA extraction, 
				PCR, DNA sequencing, data analysis, and coauthoring publications. I work with traditional Sanger sequencing, as well 
				as with second generation sequencing technology on the Illumina platform. </li>
			
				<li>My bench space is embedded in a museum exhibit called the "DNA Discovery Center". There is a wall of glass separating me and my labmates 
				from the general public. I'm a regular participant in our exhibit's "Talk to the Scientist Hour" on weekdays from 11-12. I regularly have 
				to try and explain molecular genetics, cell biology, evolutionary biology, biological anthropology, organismal biology and a variety
				of topics regarding bioinformatics and computer science to a diverse set of museum goers, ranging in age from adolescents to seniors.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>Research Assistant, Pritzker Lab for Molecular Systematics, Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago</strong></p>
