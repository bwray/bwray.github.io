<p style = "font-family: helvetica; font-size: 100%;"> The end is nigh! There are only six 
classes, no, three quarters, NO, one academic year, standing between me and my Masters’ 
degree. Wait, I’m studying CS, I should’ve broken that down the other way. One full 
academic year, no, three short quarters, NO, six tiny classes! Breaking it down like that 
makes it seem like a cake walk! The best part is that all I have left are electives. 
Wait, you mean I get to actually pick which classes I take?!?! Whaaaat?!?!
<br/><br/>
This quarter I’m enrolled in “Fundamentals of Data Science”* and “Optimized C++”. It’s an 
interesting mix of courses with a wide scope. With the data science class we will be 
getting comfortable with the super-trendy topic of “big data”. Of course, I’m excited 
about biological data, and the textbook pretty much said that it won’t be going anywhere 
near bioinformatics, but the book and the course are broad enough for me to get a lot out 
of it anyway. Then, in the C++ class we’ll literally be discussing bytes and bits and 
individual clock cycles as we try to wring all of the inefficiencies out of our programs. 
Well, not all of them, of course, but enough to feel superior to all of those lowly Python 
programmers (jk, I love Python).
<br/><br/>
Over the summer I decided to make data science the main focus of the electives I pick. OK, 
so, yes, a part of me was convinced to focus on data science because of the gobs of money 
that the world is throwing at data scientists right now. But, ignoring the philosophical 
issues that are apparent with the notion of trying to squeeze the whole of life through 
the sieve of hexadecimal numbers, there really are some wonderfully interesting problems 
that can only now be addressed because of the volume of data being generated. Plus, if I 
want to stay within the wild wonderful world of biology, I’m gonna have to know a thing or 
two about how to deal with huge volumes of sequence data. The data science class I’m taking 
now seems pretty chill. One thing I’ve learned already is that I already read a lot about 
data science, just for fun. Well, maybe not “fun”, but, you know, internet fun (i.e. 
procrastination). I spend a lot of time being cool and reading data science blogs, OK? 
<br/><br/>
Then, there’s the C++ class. I’m maybe starting to regret having enrolled in this class. 
I’m really only taking it because I think it’ll be good for me, not unlike eating 
vegetables. Except I actually do enjoy eating vegetables. My new favorite food is roasted 
broccoli. I could eat it by the fistfull! C++ programming is no roasted broccoli, that’s 
for sure. I have no intention of developing games, or device drivers, but there must be 
some utility in being comfortable with the details of how a compiler translates my mangled 
logic into awesome computational pyrotechnics, right? Plus, I mean, Facebook, OSX, Windows, 
ALLPATHS and the JVM were all at least partially written in C++. Ug, but then there’s this 
little anecdote from last night’s lecture: apparently C++ is such a complicated language 
that Bjarne Stroustrup, the super nerd who developed the language, puts himself at a solid 
6 out of 10 in terms of skill in actually programming with C++.

New music? Yea, I got the new Angel Olsen album, MY WOMAN, and I really like how lush it 
can be! I’m gonna go see her play next week at Thalia Hall. I think it’ll be the first 
concert I’ve gone to by myself in like ten years. 
<br/><br/><br/>

*Technically, I’m not even sure that I am allowed to be enrolled in my data science course. 
There was a stats prerequisite that I hadn’t fulfilled, so I taught myself intro stats over 
the summer. Yes, I do indeed know how to live life to its fullest. I was literally camping 
with friends and family, on my birthday, and reviewing statistical inference in a camping 
chair. Anyway, I took the test that DePaul offers to try and get out of the prereq, and 
I’m still awaiting the results. It should be fine.
