title: "I finally got around to building a personal website."

Finally, after two years of pretty intense computer science studies, I'm going to the trouble of making a 
personal website. The next yearof my CS master's program, at the end of which I will graduate, 
will be heavy on data science and programming. I feel that having a place to deposit my projects will be 
useful to me personally to review, but also as a way to demonstrate to the great big world what I'm 
capable of. I'll also use this as a place to share photos and to blog about software engineering and
data science, but also about some of my other interests including biking in the city, museums, photography,
food, and travel. I'll be leaving to attend [ant course](https://www.calacademy.org/scientists/ant-course)
 at the [EO Wilson Laboratory](http://www.gorongosa.org/our-story/science/information-scientists/wilson-lab)
 at [Gorongosa National Park](http://www.gorongosa.org/) in Mozambique in a little
over a week, so that will probably be the focus of the first few posts.

For now the site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author 
my posts.
